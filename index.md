My main research subjects are <span style="color:crimson;">Algebraic expander graphs</span>, <span style="color:crimson;">Quantum Cryptography</span> and <span style="color:crimson;">Verifiable Secret Sharing</span>. I am actually working as an Independent Researcher based in Morocco and developing a graph-theoretic framework for Quantum secret sharing schemes.

I did a Bachelor in Mathematical Sciences and Applications at Mohammed V University in Rabat, and a M.S. in Mathematical Analysis with thesis in Algebraic Graph Theory (2020). From 2020 to 2023 I was a PhD student in the Laboratory of Mathematics, Statistics and Applications, Faculty of Sciences in Rabat. I've been also:

- A Research intern at University of Ottawa in Canada, focused on lowering the bound of a Fully Homomorphic encryption using a sample parameter from Gaussian distribution within the project, Crypto-DID, from June to September 2023.
- Teaching at Mohammed V University in Rabat during the Academic years 2021/2022 and 2022/2023.
- Cryptography Research at National School of Applied Sciences in Tangier, Morocco (2024)
